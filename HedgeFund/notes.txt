wtf is horizon?

ts index fits hard to model - remove? - test data >4000, training data <3000
y_target has extremes 0-1 and 99-100 - gradient clipping for training
filling nans - mean? median? do it by specific code?
fill 0s? - some features have almost 50% values 0, yet max can be close to 5000000

correlation between features - remove features under 0.4 threshold (ish)
correlation of remaining features to y_target - remove features with abs(corr) near 0
XGB model with remaining features (enough clipped and dropped for overfitting? - try lightgbm if case) 
    - play with hyperparameters to determine top list of features to keep
try linear combinations with remaining features (cfv)
